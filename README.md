- 👋 Hi, I’m @shalonday
- 👀 I’m interested in FOSS that empowers people and the transformation of Information Technology to be truly informative and not disinformative.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web and enterprise software development (transitioning after graduating with a BS Biology degree). I also take classes for data science when I have time.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on software for advocacies, software for free public use.
- 📫 How to reach me: email me at alondaysp@gmail.com or shalonday@up.edu.ph
